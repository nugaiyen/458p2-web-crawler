Please create a narrative based on your research. In your narrative, please describe
the topic as well as the parameters you have used for search (5 PTS)
- why do you want to make this comparison (5 PTS)

I have a personal favor of I-405 over I-5. I grew curious on if others had the same opinions. Also both I-405 and I-5 are under construction, with I-5 having more affect on traffic flow. I am curious to see the search results and to see weather the word cloud will provide more feelings based words or news based. 

The search tearms I used for the I-5 word cloud is, ["I-5 Washington", "I5 WA", "Interstate 5", "I-5 WA"]
For I-405 I used,  ["I-405 Washington", "I405 WA", "Interstate 405", "I-405 WA"].
