## I-405 and I-5

I have a personal favor of I-405 over I-5. I want to see if others had the same opinions. Also,  both I-405 and I-5 are under construction, with I-5 having more affect on traffic flow. I am curious to see the search results and to see weather the word cloud will provide more feelings based words or news based. 

**The search tearms:**
- ["I-5 Washington", "I5 WA", "Interstate 5", "I-5 WA"]
- ["I-405 Washington", "I405 WA", "Interstate 405", "I-405 WA"]

I wanted to keep the search terms relativly similar to eachother to keek consistency when comparing. 

For the I5 word cloud, the most prominate word was "Interstate" with "Washington" in smaller font right bellow it. This is the opposite for the I-405 word cloud. It's interesting how our search terms were identical for both interstate with only the exception of the name of the interstate, yet there is this clear differentative factor right off the bat. With further inspection we can see that "Seattle" is on both I-5 and I-405 with "Bellvue" only present in I-405. From this we could infer that people also use the I-405 to enter I-5 in order to reach Seattle. I am curious on the "Video" for my I-405 cloud map. Could this be mentioned because of the youtuber's ending comments or could this also be related to the toll cameras? Both cloud maps includes "Closure" which is expected due to construction being present on both interstate. However, unlike the I-405 cloud map, I-5 also includes "Close" in a relativly bigger size. Which i not much of a surprise as multiple lanes are being closed and holds a bigger affect on drivers for traffic flow.

For improvements, I should filter out my data further to avoid confusion about the importance of certain words, such as “video.” There are also many words that end with [A hat], which raises questions about why they appear so frequently. To improve future research, I should investigate the reason for this pattern and remove those terms and other filler words ("the", "is", "a") as necessary.

I was surprised to see Renton stand out so noticeably on the I-405 word cloud map. When I think of this interstate, I usually only think as far as Bellevue, but I-405 does connect to Renton and can be a faster route for others in the area. I was also surprised that the closures and traffic caused by I-5’s major construction did not have as large of an impact as I expected. From the begining of this lab, I thought that the word cloud would include more expressive words to convey emotions of traffic.
