Please create a narrative based on your research. In your narrative, please describe
the topic as well as the parameters you have used for search (5 PTS)
- why do you want to make this comparison (5 PTS)

I have a personal favor of I-405 over I-5. I grew curious on if others had the same opinions. Also both I-405 and I-5 are under construction, with I-5 having more affect on traffic flow. I am curious to see the search results and to see weather the word cloud will provide more feelings based words or news based. 

The search tearms I used for the I-5 word cloud is; "I-5 Washington", "I5 WA", "Interstate 5", "I-5 WA".
For I-405 I used; "I-405 Washington", "I405 WA", "Interstate 405", "I-405 WA". 


- compare the word clouds and discuss the difference or similarity among the word clouds (5 PTS)
- what might be the possible reasons for the patterns you observed (5 PTS)

For the I5 word cloud, the most prominate word was "Interstate" with "Washington" is smaller font right bellow it. This is the opposite for the I-405 word cloud. It's interesting how our search terms were identical for both interstate with only the exception of the name of the interstate, yet there is this clear differentative factor right off the bat. With further inspection we can see that "Seattle" is on both I-5 and I-405 with "Bellvue" only present in I-405. From this we could infer that people use the I-405 for variety different areas in Washington. I am curious on the "Video" for my I-405 cloud map. Could this be mentioned because of the youtuber's ending comments or could this also be related to the toll cameras? Both cloud maps includes "Closure" which is expected due to construction being present on both interstate. However, unlike the I-405 cloud map, I-5 also includes "Close" in a relativly bigger size. which is also expected as multiple lanes are being closed and holds a bigger affect on the population for traffic flow.



- how your research could be improved in the future (5 PTS)

I should filter my data further to avoid confusion about the importance of certain words, such as “video.” There are also many words that end with [A hat], which raises questions about why they appear so frequently. To improve future research, I should investigate the reason for this pattern and remove those terms from the dataset when necessary.


- anything you find from the map or data that is different from your expectation before the exercise, or anything that stands out to you (5 PTS)

I was surprised to see Renton stand out so noticeably on the I-405 word cloud map. When I think of this interstate, I usually only think as far as Bellevue, but I-405 does connect to Renton and can be a faster route for others in the area. I was also surprised that the closures and traffic caused by I-5’s major construction did not have as large of an impact as I expected.

- Export the two or more word clouds to the repository and then insert them to the readme.md. (5 PTS)
